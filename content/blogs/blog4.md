Welcome, in this section I will be sharing abit about my background
 Hi my name is Tafadzwa, but everyone calls me Taffy. I was born in Zimbabwe and over the course of my life I've lived in several countries across the world. I am currently studying the Masters in Financial Analysis program at London Business School. This website will be used a biography for my life.
 
Before joining London Business School, I studied a Bachelor of Business majoring in Economics and Finance at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching sports. I play and have coached rugby. I also enjoy listening to music and reading personal development books.
