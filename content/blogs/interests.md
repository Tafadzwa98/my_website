Before you ask, no i was not in the army, that was a paintball suit!

In my free time I enjoy listening to music, reading personal development books and watching sport. I have also played and have coached rugby.

I also consider myself a foodie.



# Sports
 I enjoy both watching and playing sports mainly soccer and rugby. I support Manchester United and the Springboks, *South African rugby team*. I played both soccer and rugby in high school but unfortunately had to stop when I injured my knee during a rugby match. I was still interested in rugby and decided to become a coach and earned the level 1 World Rugby coaching certificate, which I used to coach my primary school senior team and some of the junior teams in High School. At LBS I am a member of the Mens Rugby Club, *Go Hawaiians!!*, I hope to make a comeback to rugby in the next couple of weeks when we play our first game.

# Motivational Books

During the onset of the pandemic I found myself becoming bored easily as there was nothing much to do so I decided to start reading more books. The first book I picked up was **The Compound Effect**, the book was meant to help the reader achieve their goals by teaching them how to implement good habits by making little subconscious changes that would lead to greater efficiency in ones life. I implemented some of these habits and had my best year in terms of achieving all the goals I had set for myself. From this I feel in love with personal development books and have purchased more. I am currently reading **Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins**.
