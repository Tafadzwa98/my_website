Welcome, in this section I will be sharing a bit about my background.
Hi, my name is Tafadzwa, but everyone calls me Taffy. I was born in Zimbabwe and over the course of my life I've lived in several countries across the world. I am currently studying the Masters in Financial Analysis program at London Business School. This website will be used a biography for my life.
 
Before joining London Business School, I studied a Bachelor of Business majoring in Economics and Finance at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. 

In my free time I enjoy listening to music, reading personal development books and watching sport. I have also played and have coached rugby.
