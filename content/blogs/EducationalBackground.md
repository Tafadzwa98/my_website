# What sparked my interest in finance and why LBS ?

From a very young age I knew I wanted to study Economics, mainly because I wanted to know why I was a trillionaire but couldn't afford to buy many things during the GFC crisis in Zimbabwe. This interest led me to take up economics at A'levels which I studied at Prince Edward School in Zimbabwe. 

Post high school, I studied a Bachelor of Business majoring in Economics and Finance at RMIT University. I enjoyed the course as it was practical, the one course I particularly enjoyed was the Investments module in which I had to construct and actively manage a portfolio of nine stocks from the Australian Stock exchange. 

In terms of Extra-curricular activities, I was a student mentor in the college of Business and tutored students in course such as Investments and Macroeconomics. I was also a student ambassador and the team leader for the RMIT team that took part and placed 2nd in the Refinitiv/ ACI Australia trading challenge. 

Currently, alongside the Masters in Financial Analysis programme at London Business School, I am studying for level II of the CFA program and finishing up the professional stage courses of the ACCA qualification. 
I chose to study at LBS because I believe the school will provide me the right combination of both soft and technical skills to succeed in my career.
